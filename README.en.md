🧠 IA Collector 🧠

Intelligent Catalog of AI Tools — Built with Professional Full-Stack Architecture

The IA Collector is a project that unites software engineering, information organization, and Artificial Intelligence into a single system. Its objective is Intelligent Billing Automation. It was created with a focus on scalability, architectural clarity, and continuous evolution — fundamental characteristics for modern applications.

This repository represents my way of working: structured, professional, and product-oriented.

📌 Overview

The project works as an intelligent catalog of AI tools, allowing you to:

organize AI tools into categories;

display information in a clean and responsive interface;

evolve the application to include intelligent recommendations;

serve as a foundation for studies and commercial applications;

demonstrate mastery of modern Full-Stack technologies;

The IA Collector is, at the same time:

A real project;

A professional portfolio project;

Clear proof of my ability to build complete products.

🛠️ Applied Technologies 🛠️

Technologies selected not only for modernity, but for maturity:

Front-end / Architecture

Next.js 14 (App Router)

React — decoupled components

TypeScript — safety and scalability

TailwindCSS — fast and clean UI

DevOps / Build

Vercel — optimized CI/CD and deployment

Structure prepared for unit and E2E tests

Modular Backend (in progress)

Organized handlers

Structure ready for real API and persistence (MongoDB, Supabase, PostgreSQL)

Current Features

Display and organization of AI tools

Initial structure of reusable components

Responsive and minimalist layout

Solid base for expansion toward applied AI

🔥 Project Differentials

This is not a simple project. It was built with an engineer’s mindset.

You will find:

✔️ Careful architecture
Clear structure, well-defined folders, separated responsibilities.

✔️ Planned growth
Code already prepared to support databases, filters, authentication, and external APIs.

✔️ Continuous evolution
Each commit follows the evolution of the software and of my seniority.

✔️ Professional standard
From the README to the code, everything follows real industry practices.

🚀 Professional Roadmap

This roadmap was designed with mid-level/senior-level thinking, showing strategic vision.
